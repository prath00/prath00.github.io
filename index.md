The Introduction to Datascience course tells us about CRISP-DM process and how to apply it to many Data science problems.

CRISP-DM states 6 steps:

Business understanding – What does the business need?

Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?

Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?

Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?

Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?

Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?

### CRISP-DM:

Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM):

CRISP-DM Phases
• Business Understanding
• Data Understanding
• Data Preparation
• Modeling
• Evaluation
• Deployment

Phase 1 – Business Understanding

• Define problem or opportunity

• Assess situation

• Formulate goals

Phase 2 – Data Understanding

• Data acquisition

• Data exploration

Phase 3 – Data Preparation

• Prepare data for modeling

• Address quality issues, select features to use, process data for modeling

Phase 4 – Modeling

• Determine type of problem

• Select modeling technique(s) to use

• Build model

Phase 5 – Evaluation

• Assess model performance

• Evaluate model results with respect to success criteria

Phase 6 – Deployment

• Produce final report

• Deploy model

• Monitor model
